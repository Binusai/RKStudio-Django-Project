    </ul>

    <h2>No Refunds for Completed Sessions</h2>

    <h2>Rescheduling</h2>
    <p>Clients are encouraged to contact KS Studio to reschedule a session if they are unable to attend at the originally scheduled time. While rescheduling is preferred over refunds, any refund request will be evaluated based on the circumstances and notice provided.</p>
